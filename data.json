Pus cells are WBCs - white blood cells, and less than 5 pus cells / hpf is considered to be normal, but this finding is often highlighted in red as being abnormal, and this often causes both the doctor as well as the patient to worry.The WHO Manual states that less than 1 million WBC per ml is normal, but the majority of labs never bother to measure the actual concentration of the WBCs - the technician simply eyeballs the sample and estimate this in terms of rounds cells seen in each visual field when scanning the samples through the microscope. Patients are worried that these pus cells suggest they are suffering from an occult infection - perhaps a sexually transmitted disease ( STD) which they knew they had acquired in the past, and they are worried that they can transmit this to their wife.They are also worried that this hidden infection can kill their sperm, or reduce their ability to fertilise the eggs.Doctors are also happy to \"treat\" this abnormality by putting the man on antibiotics, because these are so easy to prescribe, and because this seems to be a logical thing to do.

Prototyping and prototype testing should proceed in iterative loops until a dominant design emerges.  Based on test feedback, designers should reject some prototypes and refine others, producing higher-fidelity versions.  Once they converge on a single, favored solution, it\\u2019s time for minimum viable product testing. \n\nAn MVP is a prototype\\u2014a facsimile of the future product.  What distinguishes an MVP from other prototypes is how it is tested.  Rather than sitting across a table, getting verbal feedback from a reviewer, you put a prototype that seems like a real product in the hands of real customers in a real-world context.  The goal is to quickly but rigorously test assumptions about the demand for your solution\\u2014and gain what Eric Ries calls \\u201cvalidated learning\\u201d\\u2014with as little wasted effort as possible.

For Wings, this would include the life-stream connectors, the matching algorithm, the servers, etc. \n\nMVPs come in four basic types, depending on whether they constrain front-end functionality, back-end functionality, or both:\n\nConstrained Front-End Functionality.  These MVPs omit peripheral product features and focus only on the solution\\u2019s core front-end features.  If customers don\\u2019t perceive the core features to be valuable, there\\u2019s no point in building the rest. \n\nConstrained Back-End Functionality.  MVPs can rely on makeshift, temporary methods to perform functions that are not visible to the customer\\u2014for example, having humans analyze digital data to suggest matches instead of relying on software algorithms.

Company Valuation   This is the main deal, together with the amount that constitutes the transaction (\\u201cHow much for how much? \\u201d).  Valuation defines how much what was built so far is worth.  There is no methodological way to define it, so most likely it will be negotiated based on your alternatives.  It is defined as pre-money valuation, which is the value of what was created so far, and together with the investment amount, that forms the post-money valuation\\u2014the value of the company once the round is finalized.  There will be an immediate derivative of this valuation, which is PPS (Price Per Share) and number of shares in the company (prior to the round).    Mathematically, this is: pre-money valuation = PPS \\u00d7 number of shares prior to the round.  And then the company issues new shares to the investors at the same PPS in a total amount of the investment amount.    One note: It is important to realize that while ISO/ESOP is critical to attract and retain employees, it is mostly used by the investor as a way to lower valuation.  ISO/ESOP allocation requires issuing more shares, a new share per option, essentially increasing the number of shares and therefore lowering the PPS.  So, a $10 million pre-money valuation with 10 percent ISO/ESOP is actually less than $9 million.  It is common practice that ISO/ESOP allocation comes from current shareholders and not new ones.  To have better negotiation leverage you will need another competitive offer.      Pre-emptive Rights; Right of First Refusal; Co-Sale   Pre-emptive rights\\u2014The investor will have the right to participate in the next round to maintain its holding; so, for example, an investor with 10 percent of the company that participates in the next round can maintain its 10 percent position.
